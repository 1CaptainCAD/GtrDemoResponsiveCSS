This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.4.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Angular application with Responsive Design
This application demonstrates using Angular with Responsive Design. The application will render on phones, tablets, laptops and desktop screens.

### Features
* The application uses SCSS and is compiled into CSS. 
The application adjusts itself to small, medium and large devices. 
Please note that at this point in time this is a styling only exercise. 

* The application has three menu items `Home` which displays the Welcome screen.
The second menu item `Brands` is a pop down menu for guitar brands. Finally the
third menu item is `Add Guitar`.

* Changes the size of the browser window to see how the application responds in terms of UX.
* The other applications on my GitHub account `https://github.com/1CaptainCAD` 
namely `GtrDemoBootstrapTemplateForms` and `GtrDemoBootstrapReactiveForms` demonstrate
complete application functionality.
